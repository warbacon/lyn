# Lyn ⚡

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Work in progress!

Lyn is a **dead-simple, lightweight web server** for serving files and browsing
directories. Think of it as a minimal replacement for Python’s `http.server` —
but with a cleaner and more modern interface.

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
lyn
```

This will start a server in the current directory. You can then open
<http://localhost:8080>.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Lyn is **intended for personal or development use only**. It’s not ready for
production environments.
